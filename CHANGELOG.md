## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Integration with codecov.io.
- Recipe for the *Anopheles gambiae* genome.
- Recipe for the *Homo sapiens* genome.
- Recipe for the *Theobroma cacao* genome.
- Some version-specific recipes.
    - TAIR6
    - *Apis mellifera* assembly 2.0 / OGS 1.0
    - *Apis mellifera* assembly 4.5 / OGS 3.2
- Recipes for 9 species of green algae.
- The `cleanup` and `cluster` tasks for the main build script.

### Changed
- Unit test fixtures to account for AEGeAn's improved reporting of iLocus types.
- Protein checksum for *Xenopus tropicals*, which was recently updated to drop the *Silurana* designation.

## [0.2.1] - 2016-01-15

- Multiprocessing support for build script.

### Changed
- Complete overhaul of the genome configuration handling (now in the `registry` module).
- Minor changes to the Travis CI configuration.
- Excluded *Danio rerio* config from CI tests, as its resource requirements are right at the limit of what the Travis VMs can handle.
- Updated *Xenopus tropicalis* config to drop the parentheses in the species name.
- Updated *Drosophila melanogaster* config to the latest RefSeq assembly/annotation.
- Moved sha1 and file resolution code from `__init__.py` to `GenomeDB` class.
