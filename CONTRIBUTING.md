Thanks for your interest in GenHub!

- If you are having problems, or would like to report a bug or request a feature, please create a new thread on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/standage/genhub/issues).

By engaging with GenHub's developers and users, you are agreeing to our [code of conduct](docs/CONDUCT.md).
In short, we want to create a space where people feel comfortable and welcome to discuss, ask questions about, or contribute to the project.
And if the language of the code of conduct seems a bit grandiose for a small project, just realize it was adapted from a code of conduct designed for much larger communities!
