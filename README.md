GenHub
======

GenHub is software for managing your own hub of annotated genome assemblies. It
comes configured with simple recipes to collect and standardize data from a
variety of sources, and it is easy to extend with recipes for additional data.

## Obtaining GenHub

The easiest way to obtain the latest and greatest version of GenHub is to clone
the git repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/standage/genhub.git
cd genhub
make check
```

Another option is to download a stable version from the [release listing][rel].

```bash
# replace x.y.z with an actual version
wget https://github.com/standage/genhub/archive/x.y.z.tar.gz
tar -xzf x.y.z.tar.gz
cd genhub-x.y.z
make check
```

## Prerequistes

GenHub is implemented primarily in Python, and should be compatible with Python
2.7+ and Python 3.3+. In addition to the Python packages listed in
`requirements.txt` file, GenHub depends on the [GenomeTools library][gt] and
the [AEGEan toolkit][agn]. Running `make depend` with administrative privileges
or within a user-controlled [virtual environment][venv] will install the
prerequisite Python packages, and installation instructions for GenomeTools and
AEGeAn are available from the corresponding source code distributions.

**Special note about PycURL**: There are (or have been) some issues installing
PycURL in a virtual environment. If you are having issues installing PycURL,
the [following workaround][curl] worked for me: deactivate the virtualenv,
install PycURL system-wide (or in a directory you control), and then copy the
pycurl files into your virtualenv site-packages.
